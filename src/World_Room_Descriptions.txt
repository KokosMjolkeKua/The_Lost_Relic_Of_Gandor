Part I: Overworld
ROOM 1:
You stand in a quiet forest clearing. The way behind is blocked by dense trees. A single path leads
north. Your shoes are in your inventory, ready to equip.
ROOM 2:
You step north into a mossy forest. Sunlight filters through thick branches. The air smells damp. Paths
lead north and west.
ROOM 3:
The northern path ends at a muddy cliff. Sunlight warms the rocks. You can attempt to climb. Without
shoes, a fall is deadly.
ROOM 4:
Atop the cliff, you find a small campsite with leather armour, fur gauntlets, and a rusty dagger. The
clearing offers a distant view of a castle. No other paths exist; climb down using the attached rope.
ROOM 5:
Heading west, vegetation thickens. The wind rustles the leaves, but nothing is visible. The trail
continues west.
ROOM 6:
You find a large metal and wood door embedded in the mountainside, with a rusty keyhole. A path also
leads west. Without the rusty key, the door does not budge. Attacking with the rusty dagger will break it.
ROOM 7:
A stone wall features a mural depicting a great battle. Something small glimmers within. Using the rusty
dagger reveals a square sapphire. Paths continue north and west.
ROOM 8:
A small clearing holds a rusty key atop burnt clothing.
ROOM 9:
Brush and barbed wire fill the area. An apple lies nearby to pick up.
ROOM 10:
Using the rusty key, you unlock the door from room 6. A long corridor stretches ahead. At the end,
paths lead north and east. Climbing the eastern section requires climbing shoes or a grappling hook;
without confirmation, attempting may cause death.
ROOM 11:
A goblin lurks ahead. You hide in a bush. Bare-handed attacks prompt confirmation. Paths exist north
and west, though the western path is blocked.
ROOM 12:
A clearing filled with butterflies spreads out before you. The path continues north.
ROOM 13:
A rock wall blocks the way. An inscription reads: 'What has an eye but cannot see?' You need a needle
to proceed.
ROOM 14:
Climbing from room 10, the path west leads to room 11. Another path continues north.
ROOM 15:
A goblin appears. You must attack immediately or wait and be killed. The goblin drops a needle and a
red ruby. Only the return path exists.
ROOM 16:
Dense forest surrounds you. Paths lead south, east, and north. A light rain begins.
ROOM 17:
A chilling mural of flowers lies in a small clearing.
ROOM 18:
A slime approaches. It does no damage. You may run or attack, causing it to flee.
ROOM 19:
Dense forest continues. Paths lead south and east.
ROOM 20:
A cold, dead campfire rests nearby. A skeleton lies beside a sack containing climbing shoes.
ROOM 21:
A goblin spots you and flees east. Paths continue east and north.
ROOM 22:
A long path with murky waters stretches north, swamp-like on both sides.
ROOM 23:
A stronger goblin requires the rusty dagger to defeat. It drops five arrows and a broken bow. A path
leads east.
ROOM 24:
Swampy paths continue east and south.
ROOM 25:
A small chest hides a glowing red orb, a bone key, and two rubies.
ROOM 26:
A small hut appears with eerie music and cackling inside. Peering through the window, you see an old
lady brewing in a pot. Options: 1. Attack if fully equipped to claim black robe, two healing potions, a
sapphire, and a shield. 2. Decline her drink and fight if equipped to survive. 3. Give her an apple to earn
her favor, black robe, two healing potions, and the ability to trade.
ROOM 27:
A clearing lies east of room 21. A goblin camp is visible south. The only path leads south.
ROOM 28:
The goblin camp is small but fortified. Initial goblins must be defeated with arrows. The goblin lord
requires both shield and sword. Rewards: 5 rubies, stone key, fireproof underpants, and a world map.
ROOM 29:
Two goblins guard a massive northern door. Solve a riddle and provide the bone key and sapphire to
pass. Fighting is futile.
ROOM 30:
A clearing opens with a path south.
ROOM 31:
A steep hill rises south of room 30. At the top, you see the castle to the west and a secret path
northwest to rooms 32-37. Climbing requires boots.
ROOM 32:
Dense forest continues north. A secret eastern path appears only if you have visited room 31.
ROOM 33:
Paths branch east and west.
ROOM 34:
Path leads south from the west branch.
ROOM 35:
A stone jigsaw puzzle lies ahead. Completing it reveals a mural of a man kneeling before a massive
dragon with a red orb â€” a hint for later.

A path leads north from the east branch.
ROOM 37:
The secret path east leads to a small clearing. Rustling comes from the south. Paths continue east,
north, and south.

ROOM 39:
A glimmering chest in rocks holds an apple.

A goblin is here. Use the black robe to sneak past or confront him. Path continues north.
ROOM 42:
A clearing stretches with paths east and west.
ROOM 43:
A goblin guards this area. Attacking yields a ruby. Using the black robe allows sneaking. Path continues
north.
ROOM 44:
A chest bears a riddle: 'I am born in fear, raised in truth, and come to my own in deed.' Correct answer
'courage' opens it to reveal a missing jigsaw puzzle piece.
ROOM 45:
A climbable path south requires climbing boots and grappling hook. Path north is available.
ROOM 46:
Atop the hill, the path west leads to a platinum sword, and north continues further.
ROOM 47:
A small rock holds the platinum sword. Must have defeated 8 goblins and/or the Dragon to claim it.

Brush conceals a crevice. Steel gauntlets lie within. Path east is possible to squeeze through.

North path continues from 45 or via crevice from 48.

The Dragon's den: massive burnt crater. The black and red dragon sleeps. Options: sneak with black
robe, fight with full equipment, or kneel with orb per mural hint. Rewards include dragon horn, emerald
key, steel armour, royal cape.

Top of the mountain, climb south with boots and binoculars. View dragon's crater north and castle
south. Binoculars reveal a staircase into the castle.

Part II: Black Castle
LEVEL 1:
A long, cozy hallway with a chandelier. A feast lies on the table, but eating is deadly. A stone golem
blocks the staircase north. Solve riddles or fight if equipped with steel gear. Rewards include the Goblet
of Gandor and poisonous darts.
LEVEL 2:
Upstairs, a walkpath surrounds a large gap. A silver necklace shines, but touching it is deadly. A
growling tree blocks the next corridor. Defeat it with platinum sword, steel gear, or fire staff. A hidden
door reveals stairs to the final level.
LEVEL 3:
The final room has an altar. Placing the Goblet of Gandor summons a divine figure. To defeat the
shadowy entity, you must have full steel gear and royal cape, or throw poisonous darts with climbing
boots. Victory leads to the old lady outside thanking you.
